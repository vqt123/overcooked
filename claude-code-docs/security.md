# Security

Learn about Claude Code's security safeguards and best practices for safe usage.

## How we approach security

### Security foundation

Your code's security is paramount. Claude Code is built with security at its core, developed according to Anthropic's comprehensive security program. Learn more and access resources (SOC 2 Type 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate, etc.) at [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com).

### Permission-based architecture

Claude Code uses strict read-only permissions by default. When additional actions are needed (editing files, running tests, executing commands), Claude Code requests explicit permission. Users control whether to approve actions once or allow them automatically.

We designed Claude Code to be transparent and secure. For example, we require approval for `git` commands before executing them, giving you direct control. This approach enables users and organizations to configure permissions directly.

For detailed permission configuration, see [Identity and Access Management](/en/docs/claude-code/iam).

### Built-in protections

To mitigate risks in agentic systems:

- **Folder access restriction**: Claude Code can only access the folder where it was started and its subfoldersâ€”it cannot go upstream to parent directories. This creates a clear security boundary, ensuring Claude Code only operates within the intended project scope
- **Prompt fatigue mitigation**: Support for allowlisting frequently used safe commands per-user, per-codebase, or per-organization
- **Accept Edits mode**: Batch accept multiple edits while maintaining permission prompts for commands with side effects

### User responsibility

Claude Code only has the permissions you grant it. You're responsible for reviewing proposed code and commands for safety before approval.

## Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant's instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

### Core protections

- **Permission system**: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- **Context-aware analysis**: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
- **Command blocklist**: Blocks risky commands that fetch
