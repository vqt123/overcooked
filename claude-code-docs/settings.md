# Claude Code settings

Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude Code through hierarchical settings:

- **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all projects.
- **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  - `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
- For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project settings. System administrators can deploy policies to `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux and Windows via WSL.

### Example settings.json

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```
