# Development containers

The preconfigured [devcontainer setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) works seamlessly with VS Code's Remote - Containers extension and similar tools.

The container's enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation. We've included a [reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) that you can customize for your needs.

> While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices and monitor Claude's activities.

## Key features

- **Production-ready Node.js**: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
- **Security by design**: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
- **Developer-friendly tools**: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
- **Seamless VS Code integration**: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
- **Session persistence**: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
- **Works everywhere**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

## Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the [Claude Code reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

## Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

- [**devcontainer.json**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
- [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile): Defines the container
