# Overcooked Multiplayer Game - Implementation Details

## Project Overview
A realtime multiplayer web-based game inspired by Overcooked, featuring cooking mechanics, order management, and multiplayer synchronization.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 + TypeScript + Vite 5.4.10
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io 4.8.1
- **Game Engine**: Custom 2D canvas-based engine
- **Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end browser testing
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **GameCanvas.tsx**: Main React component wrapping the game
- **GameEngine.ts**: Core game loop, rendering, and state management
- **Player.ts**: Player entity with movement, rendering, and item handling
- **Ingredient.ts**: Ingredient system with cooking states and mechanics
- **Order.ts**: Order generation, timing, and completion logic
- **KitchenObject.ts**: Interactive kitchen stations (stove, prep, serving)
- **InputManager.ts**: Keyboard input handling (WASD + Space)
- **MultiplayerManager.ts**: Socket.io client for real-time synchronization

### Backend Server
- **Socket.io Server**: Handles real-time multiplayer synchronization
- **Game State Management**: Centralized player positions, ingredients, orders
- **Event Broadcasting**: Player movements, interactions, score updates

## Game Mechanics

### Core Systems
1. **Movement**: WASD controls with collision detection and boundary constraints
2. **Ingredient System**: 4 types (tomato, lettuce, bread, cheese) with states (raw, chopped, cooked, burnt)
3. **Cooking Pipeline**: Pick up → Chop → Cook → Serve
4. **Order System**: Random order generation with 30-second timers and scoring
5. **Multiplayer Sync**: Real-time position and action synchronization

### Kitchen Layout
- **Ingredient Box**: Green station for picking up random ingredients
- **Prep Counter**: Silver station for chopping ingredients
- **Stove**: Brown station for cooking chopped ingredients
- **Serving Counter**: Yellow station for order completion

### Scoring System
- **Points**: 100 points per completed order (decreases over time)
- **Penalties**: -50 points for expired orders
- **Time Pressure**: Orders expire after 30 seconds

## Multiplayer Implementation

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Player Positions**: Continuous position updates sent to all clients
- **Item States**: Ingredient pickup/drop synchronized across players
- **Game State**: Orders, scores, and cooking states shared globally
- **Connection Management**: Dynamic player colors and IDs

### Socket.io Events
- `playerMove`: Position updates
- `playerItemUpdate`: Item pickup/drop events
- `ingredientUpdate`: Cooking station ingredient changes
- `orderUpdate`: Order completion/generation
- `scoreUpdate`: Score changes

## Configuration Solutions

### Vite Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: Vite 7.0.3 `crypto.hash` incompatibility with Node.js v21.1.0
**Solution**: Downgraded to Vite 5.4.10 for Node.js compatibility
**Configuration**: ES modules with `"type": "module"` and `vite.config.mts`

### Server Management
**Implementation**: Used tsx for direct TypeScript execution
**Process Management**: nohup with PID tracking for proper server lifecycle
```bash
nohup npm run server > server.log 2>&1 & echo $! > server.pid
nohup npm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 & echo $! > dev.pid
```

## Testing Strategy

### Playwright End-to-End Tests
- **Game Loading**: Canvas visibility and dimensions
- **Player Movement**: WASD input and position updates
- **Ingredient Interactions**: Pickup, chopping, cooking workflow
- **Order System**: Order display and completion
- **Multiplayer**: Two-browser testing with synchronization
- **Screenshots**: Visual verification of all major features

### Test Coverage
✅ All 6 test cases passed  
✅ 10 screenshots generated for visual verification  
✅ Multiplayer connections verified in server logs

## Performance Considerations
- **60 FPS Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal canvas clears and targeted redraws
- **Network Optimization**: Only send position updates when player moves
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Game Mechanics Improvements (2025-07-10)

### Fixed Order Completion System
**Problem**: Original implementation only supported single-ingredient orders, preventing completion of complex recipes.  
**Solution**: 
- Added `Plate` class for recipe assembly
- Updated `InteractionHandler.checkOrderCompletion()` to support multi-ingredient validation
- Implemented proper plate-based order matching for complex recipes

### Enhanced Visual Feedback
**Implementation**:
- Clear ingredient state visualization (raw/chopped/cooked/burnt) with distinct colors
- Ingredient labels with first letter indicators  
- Order displays with colored ingredient requirements
- Real-time cooking progress through color changes
- Time countdown and dynamic point values

### Improved Kitchen Layout
**Enhancements**:
- Added specific ingredient boxes: Tomato (red), Lettuce (green), Bread (beige), Cheese (cream)
- Added Plate Stack station for recipe assembly
- Color-coded stations for intuitive gameplay
- Optimized station positioning for multiplayer workflow

### Recipe Assembly System
**New Mechanics**:
- Players can pick up plates from Plate Stack
- Ingredients can be added to plates on Prep Counter
- Multi-ingredient orders require proper plate assembly
- Serving validates complete recipes against order requirements

### Updated Game Flow
1. **Ingredient Pickup**: Choose specific ingredients from colored boxes
2. **Preparation**: Chop ingredients on Prep Counter
3. **Cooking**: Cook chopped ingredients on Stove (optional)
4. **Assembly**: Add prepared ingredients to plates
5. **Serving**: Deliver completed recipes to Serving Counter

## Future Enhancements
- **Ingredient Inventory**: Allow multiple ingredients on one plate  
- **Recipe Book**: Visual guide for complex orders
- **Cooking Timers**: Visual progress bars for cooking ingredients
- **Power-ups**: Speed boosts, time extensions
- **Level Progression**: Multiple kitchen layouts
- **Audio**: Sound effects and background music
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls for mobile devices
